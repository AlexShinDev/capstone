You can insert a page break and put in placeholder text to create a multipage file.

# When the document looks the way you want it, go to the File menu and select Save As. In the Save As box in the Windows version of Word, choose the option to store the file on your computer and give it a recognizable name, as you normally would with a new document. In the Save as Type menu, click the drop-down menu and choose Word Template instead of the regular document format. Click the Save button to store the new template in Wordâ€™s folder for custom Office templates. (In Word 2016 for Mac, go to the File menu and choose Save as Template.)

# Later, when you want to use your new letterhead template, open Word. In the Windows version, go into the File menu to New, choose Personal and select your template. In the Mac edition, go to the File menu, choose New from Template and select your creation from the thumbnails. A new document opens based on your template design, and this time you can save it as a standard Word document and start writing."
